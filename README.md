🧠 Predicting Calorie Burn from Physiological and Workout Data Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict calorie burn based on various physiological and workout parameters such as heart rate, duration, age, and exercise intensity. Using machine learning models, the system analyzes relationships between input features and energy expenditure to provide accurate calorie burn estimates.

🔍 Project Objectives

Collect and preprocess physiological and workout data

Explore and visualize data patterns related to calorie expenditure

Build and evaluate multiple ML models for calorie burn prediction

Compare model performance and identify the most accurate predictor

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn / XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Expected Outcome

A machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of calories burned during a workout session based on physiological and activity data.
